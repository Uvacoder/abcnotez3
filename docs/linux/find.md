## `find`

### Find by name

```shell
find -name "query"
find -iname "query" # Ignore case
find -not -name "query_to_avoid"
find \! -name "query_to_avoid"
```

### Find by type

```shell
find -type <type_descriptor> <query> # Basic usage
# Common type descriptors:
# f: file
# d: directory
# l: symlink
# c: character device
# b: block device

find /usr -type f -name "*.conf" # Search for files ending in `.conf` in `/usr` directory
find /usr -type f -and -name "*.conf" # Equivalent to above; `-and` combines two queries
find -name query_1 -or -name query_2 # `-or` returns results that match either expression

```

### Find by size

```shell
find -size <number><suffix> # Basic usage
# Common suffixes
# c: bytes
# k: kilobytes
# M: megabytes
# G: gigabytes
# b: 512-byte blocks

find /usr -size 50c # Find all files in `/usr` exactly 50 bytes in size
find /usr -size -50c # Less than 50 bytes in size
find /usr -size +600M # More than 600 megabytes in size

```

### Find by time

:::info

- **Access time (`atime`)**: The last time a file was read or written to.
- **Modification time (`mtime`)**: The last time the contents of the file were modified.
- **Change time (`ctime`)**: The last time the fileâ€™s inode metadata was changed.

:::

```shell
find /usr -mtime 1 # Files modified within the last day
find /usr -atime -1 # Accessed less than a day ago
find /usr -ctime +3 # Meta information changed more than 3 days ago
find /usr -mmin -1 # Modified within the last minute
find / -newer reference_file # Created/changed more recently than reference_file
```

### Find by owner

```shell
find / -user <user>
find / -group <group>
```

### Find by permissions

```shell
find / -perm 644
find / -perm -644 # Files with at least these permisions
```

### Filter by depth

```shell
find -mindepth <num>
find -maxdepth <num>
```

### Execute commands on `find` results

```shell
find <find_parameters> -exec <command_and_options> {} \;
find . -type d -perm 755 -exec chmod 700 {} \; # Change directory permissions from 755 to 700
```

## `locate`

:::info

`locate` is faster because it searches through a prebuilt database of files generated by the `updatedb` command or a cronjob automatically created during installation that runs every 24 hours. To manually update the database, use `sudo updatedb`.

:::

```shell
locate <query> # Return files whose full path names contain the query
locate -b <query> # Return only files whose names contain the query
locate -n 10 *.py # Limit to 10 results; Wildcard search
locate -i readme.md # Case-insensitive search
locate -c *.md # Display number of found entries
locate -S # Print statistics about each used database
```
